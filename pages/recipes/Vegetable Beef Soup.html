  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p>1 lb of ground beef</br>
    2 lb bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, green beans, carrots)</br>
    4 cups of beef broth (I used reduced sodium)</br>
    1 small can of tomato paste</br>
    2-3 celery stalks</br>
    2 big carrots</br>
    1/2 sweet onion chopped</br>
    1/3 - 1/2 cup Barley</br>
    Seasonings: salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning</br>
    Optional: 1/2 cabbage, garlic salt</p>

  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Directions:</br>
  - Put ground beef into pot and fill with water until covered</br>
  - While ground beef is cooking, chop onion, add onion, celery, carrots, seasonings: ~1 TB of salt, 1 tsp pepper, garlic powder, Italian</br>
  - As beef browns, add more water to cover ingredients and simmer until vegetables are soft</br>
  - After vegetables are soft, take celery and carrots out to cool (throw away if you don’t want to chop them back into soup)</br>
  - Add 2 lb bag of mixed veggies, 1 can of tomato paste, beef broth</br>
  - If all ingredients are NOT submerged, add more water</br>
  - Bring to a light boil then simmer for 1-2 hours (the longer it summers, the more flavor it has)</br>
  - Add barley and continue to simmer (same simmer note as above)</p>
